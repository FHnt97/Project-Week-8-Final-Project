    "I will look into the fields of industry with the highest innovation/ patent number filing, and I will carry out a market analysis in this field, looking into which companies are the strongest and invest the most in R&D in given field. I will try answering the following questions: \n",

    "- Q2.2: In that field, what companies do we have, how much do they invest into R&D compared to their profits?\n",

    "- Q3: Taking a start-up database, what is the drop rate of companies in that field (if last funding longer than 5 years ago = inactive)?"
